    "description":"Theme Test Drive Wordpress plugin allows you to safely test drive any theme on your blog as administrator, while visitors still use the default one. 

It happens completely transparent and they will not even notice you run a different theme for yourself. 

Best part is you can even set the testing theme options (if it has them) in the Admin panel while you are testing the theme.

You can also preview any theme by adding '?theme=xxx' to your blog URL. For example http://www.myblog.com/?theme=Default

Plugin by Vladimir Prelovac. Need a <a href='http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/services'>WordPress Consultant</a>?",
    "installation":"1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.

3. Use the Options page to set the theme you want to test drive.

The selected theme will be visible only to blog administrator.  

Other visitors of the blog will always see the default theme. 

Note: if you use WP-Cache plugin, you might need to disable it (or setup to exclude pages)",
